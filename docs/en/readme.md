# Documentation
Add your documentation in the docs/en folder as markdown. Note the "en" refers to the langugae used in the documentation you provide.
If you documentation is vast, you can split it into many markdown files and sub folders.

Look over the [guidance on documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/documentation/) 

Make sure to remove this readme in your actual module!
